# Greenden-Talwind
GreenDen is a clean and modern frontend website project designed for a fictional plant shop. Built with HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS, the site is fully responsive and showcases a minimal yet elegant user interface. It includes three main pages:

Home Page: Features a welcoming hero section, an introduction to GreenDen, and highlights of key services or benefits.

Product Page: Displays a grid of plant products with images, names, and prices. The layout is responsive and includes smooth hover effects using Tailwind utility classes.

Contact Page: Includes a contact form with fields for name, email, and message, as well as space for contact information and optional map integration.

This project is perfect for learning or demonstrating how to build static websites with Tailwind CSS, including clean layout design, responsive structure, and user-friendly UI elements.
